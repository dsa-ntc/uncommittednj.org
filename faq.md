# Frequently Asked Questions

{{ page.description }}

## How will this help stop the genocide?

Voting "Uncommitted" will let the Democratic Party and general public know what's at stake and how many voters they're losing over their unwavering position on the genocide in Gaza. This will pressure the Biden administration to reconsider their position and call for a ceasefire.

## Do I have to be registered as a Democrat?

Yes, you do in order to vote in the Democratic Presidential Primary Election on
June 4, 2024 in NJ.

## Shouldn't I just switch my registration to Undeclared?

Being part in this mass action helps your vote apply pressure in an acute, intentional, and measurable way that changing your party registration doesn't.

## If I vote Uncommitted for President will I lose my vote for Senate or Congress?
No! You can still vote for any candidates you choose for Senate, Congress, and
local positions that are on your ballot. 

## Won't this help Trump win?

Biden needs to earn the votes of his constituents, and that means listening to
the overwhelming majority who want a ceasefire now. We refuse to believe that we
must choose the lesser of two evils, especially without any accountability or
pressure to do what is morally right.

## Is this like what happened in Michigan?

Absolutely! [Listen to Michigan](https://www.listentomichigan.com) is what
inspired this campaign. Swing states are crucial to the 2024 election, and we're
following Michigan's lead.
