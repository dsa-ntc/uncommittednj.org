    <h2>NO VOTES FOR GENOCIDE</h2>
    <p><b>We will withhold our vote from Vice President Kamala
Harris and all Congressional Democratic Party candidates on the ballot this
November 5th unless there is an arms embargo and permanent ceasefire imposed on
Israel.</b></p>

   <p>The Biden administration is a full partner in the genocide in Gaza. While
Democratic Party leaders claim to be “working tirelessly” for a ceasefire, they
have provided over <a
href="https://news.antiwar.com/2024/08/26/israel-says-us-has-delivered-50000-tons-of-military-aid-since-start-of-gaza-slaughter/">$20.8
billion dollars</a> in weapons for Israel’s mass slaughter
of Palestinians since October 7th.

  <p>Democratic voters have repeatedly demanded an arms embargo and permanent
ceasefire from the Biden administration. <a
href="https://x.com/_waleedshahid/status/1829132798277320855">Recent polling
shows that 77% of Democrats and 61% of all Americans oppose weapons aid for
Israel’s assault on Gaza.</a> At the Democratic National Convention, Democratic
and Uncommitted delegates also called on Vice President Harris to adopt a
ceasefire and arms embargo into her platform. In response, the Harris campaign
explicitly rejected the premise of an arms embargo and barred a Palestinian
speaker from taking the stage.</p>

  <p>The Harris campaign and Congressional Democratic candidates across the
country have had ample opportunity to adopt a humanitarian position on Gaza.
Instead, Democratic Party leaders remain staunch war criminals who facilitate
genocide and carry out flagrant violations of national and international
law.</p>
 
 <p><a
href="https://www.veteransforpeace.org/files/4017/0777/8707/VFP_StDept_ltr_FINAL_2-11-24.pdf">In
a letter to the State Department demanding a termination of weapons</a>,
thousands of veterans from across our nation laid bare every violation of
federal law: the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, the Foreign Assistance Act,
the Arms Export Control Act, The U.S. War Crimes Act, the Leahy Law, and the
Genocide Convention Implementation Act. This is in addition to customary
international law: the Geneva Convention and the Genocide Convention. <b>It’s
high time for Democratic voters to hold our party accountable.</b> </p>

 <p>We refuse to be complicit in genocide. We refuse to vote for a party that
callously ignores our demands and the <a
href="https://www.cepr.net/press-release/poll-majority-of-americans-say-biden-should-halt-weapons-shipments-to-israel/">will
of the American people.</a> We refuse to allow our government to commit war
crimes in our name. Our demand is simple: our vote is earned by a restoration of
the rule of law, the delivery of an arms embargo, and a permanent ceasefire.</p>
