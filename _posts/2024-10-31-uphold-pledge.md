No Votes for Genocide launched on September 1st, 2024 as a national campaign to use workers’ remaining electoral leverage to win an arms embargo from the Biden-Harris administration. We pledged we would not reward any political party committed to the genocide of Palestinians. Since then, we have collected thousands of signatures nationwide. Swing-state specific campaigns catering to their local organizing contexts have shown how even in places with vital margins, the genocide of Palestinians cannot be ignored. We are now calling on every signatory to uphold their pledge to withhold their vote from the Democratic ticket.

Since launching this campaign, Israel has escalated its genocidal project by firebombing the Al Aqsa Hospital tent and countless other civilian targets, banning UNWRA, and carrying out a complete starvation and ethnic cleansing of Northern Gaza. We’ve also seen an expansion of Israeli aggression into Lebanon, leaving thousands dead in just a few weeks, and further attacks on Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Democrats remain firm that they will continue to fund and support this violence if elected this November.

In such a tight race, Democrats should be fighting to earn every vote they can, including the pro-peace contingent. Instead, they are “honored” to have Iraq war architect Dick Cheney endorse their campaign and refuse to take any action to stop the genocide. Meanwhile, policies of a ceasefire and an arms embargo remain majorly popular among the Democratic electorate.

If Harris loses this election, it is inevitable that voters of conscience, especially Muslim and Arab voters, will be lambasted as spoilers who helped elect Trump. Let’s be clear– any losses incurred by the Democratic Party this election will be the result of their commitment to genocide.

We will continue to work in coalition across the anti-genocide movement and fight for Palestinian livelihood regardless of who wins this election.

When you enter the ballot box, we implore you to keep Hind, Refaat, Shaban, and every Palestinian killed, brutalized, and traumatized by the Biden-Harris administration in your heart.
