# Frequently Asked Questions

{{ page.description }}

## How will this help stop the genocide?

Voting "Uncommitted" will let the Democratic Party and general public know
what's at stake and how many voters they're losing over their unwavering
position on the genocide in Gaza. This will pressure the Biden administration to
reconsider their position and call for a ceasefire.

## Do I have to be registered as a Democrat?

Yes, you do in order to vote in the Democratic Presidential Primary Election on
June 4, 2024 in NJ.

## Shouldn't I just switch my registration to Undeclared?

Being part in this mass action helps your vote apply pressure in an acute,
intentional, and measurable way that changing your party registration doesn't.

## If I vote Uncommitted for President will I lose my vote for Senate or Congress?
No! You can still vote for any candidates you choose for Senate, Congress, and
local positions that are on your ballot. 

## Won't this help Trump win?

Biden needs to earn the votes of his constituents, and that means listening to
the overwhelming majority who want a ceasefire now. We refuse to believe that we
must choose the lesser of two evils, especially without any accountability or
pressure to do what is morally right.

## Do you think this will make a difference in a deep blue state like N.J.?

Governor Murphy only won his re-election by about 84,000 votes which is only
about 2.5 percent. Which means there are enough registered Democrats fed up with
the way things are that they will gladly vote for a good cause like ours.

## What about the marginalized people (Muslim, Black, Hispanic, Queer) who will be vulnerable if Trump is office? 

Other marginalized people in this country have been experiencing unimaginable
levels of violence and oppression whether there is a Democrat or a Republican in
office. This is our chance to build power together and fight back against
oppression no matter who is in the White House.

## Is this like what happened in Michigan?

Absolutely! [Listen to Michigan](https://www.listentomichigan.com) is what
inspired this campaign. Swing states are crucial to the 2024 election, and we're
following Michigan's lead.
