**Trenton, NJ**  — Despite the refusal of certain counties to include
“Uncommitted” in their ballot draws, the Vote Uncommitted NJ campaign proudly
announces its inclusion on the ballot in all 21 counties across the state. This
historic milestone, made possible by volunteers from New Jersey’s 3 chapters of
the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and allies, underscores our
unwavering commitment to democratic principles and ensuring that every voice is
heard in the political process.

The challenges Vote Uncommitted NJ has encountered in securing ballot access
serve as a stark reminder of the anti-democratic practices that persist within
New Jersey’s government, both at the local and national levels, particularly in
recent months as President Biden and his administration have ignored the
overwhelming public demand for a ceasefire in Palestine.

“Despite these challenges, Vote Uncommitted NJ remains resolute in our
commitment to justice and equality. We refuse to be silenced or sidelined in the
face of injustice,” said Democratic Socialists of America member and Uncommitted
NJ leader Michelle Guengue. “That is why we proudly declare our demands for a
cessation of all arms shipments and aid–both military and economic–to Israel
from the United States.” 

“We cannot stand idly by as our taxpayer dollars continue to fuel violence and
oppression,” said Brad Helias, another Democratic Socialists of America member
and Uncommitted NJ leader. “As we continue to build our movement and organize
for change, we invite our supporters, advocacy organizations, and concerned
citizens to join us for the virtual launch rally of Vote Uncommitted New
Jersey.” 

The virtual rally will take place on April 21st at 5:00PM. To register, visit

complicity in it.
