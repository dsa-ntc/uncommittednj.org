* This campaign is not an endorsement of any party or candidate, it is a protest
of the current undemocratic poilitical system which has failed to accomodate the
popular demand for justice in Palestine. 

* We demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. 

* We demand the immediate and unrestricted entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. 

* We stand for the liberation of Palestine. 

* We demand the immediate cessation of all arms shipments, military and economic
* aid from the United States to Israel.
