# Frequently Asked Questions

{{ page.description }}

## How will this help stop the genocide?

Writing in "Uncommitted" will let the Democratic Party and general public know what's at stake and how many voters they're losing over their unwavering position on the genocide in Gaza. This will pressure the Biden administration to reconsider their position and call for a ceasefire.

## Do I have to be registered as a Democrat?

Yes, you do in order to vote in the Democratic Presidential Primary Election on April 24, 2024 in PA.

## Shouldn't I just switch my registration to Independent?

Being part in this mass action helps your vote apply pressure in an acute, intentional, and measurable way that changing your party registration doesn't.

## Won't this help Trump win?

Biden needs to earn the votes of his constituents, and that means listening to the overwhelming majority who want a ceasefire now. We refuse to believe that we must choose the lesser of two evils, especially without any accountability or pressure to do what is morally right.

## Is this like what happened in Michigan?

Absolutely! [Listen to Michigan](https://www.listentomichigan.com) is what inspired this campaign. Swing states are crucial to the 2024 election, and we're following Michigan's lead.
