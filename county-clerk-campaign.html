<h2>County Clerk Messaging Campaign: Help us demand a fair ballot!</h2>

<img src="assets/clerk-ballot-image.png">
    <p>Over the past month DSA NJ and other allies collected more than 3,500 signatures to get Uncommitted on the ballot, 
        as a way to protest against Genocide Joe in the Democratic Primary.
        
    <p>>Unsurprisingly, the NJ Democratic machine is up to their usual tricks. County clerks have broad authority to order and design 
     the ballot and they are trying to mislead voters by hiding the Uncommitted option in a tiny font at the bottom of the ballot. 
        
    <p>We need all our community members to let them know this is unacceptable. Please take 1 minute to generate an email to your county clerk here:
        
    <p>All you have to do is click your counties name and an email will be generated.</p>

    <p> If your button does not work please copy and past the following script
     
    <p> Dear County Clerk,

    <p> As people impacted by US elections, we demand fairness and transparency in our Ballots. Counties have been opaque and inconsistent in their handling of Uncommitted.

         <li>- We request Sec of State clarify the situation and direct all counties to present Uncommitted on the ballot in office block format with similar font size, capitalization and slogan present.

         <li>-We request counties correct any omissions of our slate on state websites and notify us by Monday of corrections.

         <li>-We request you direct any counties who excluded our slate from ballot drawing on Thursday to re-draw choices for President or explain under what authority we were to be excluded from the drawing
