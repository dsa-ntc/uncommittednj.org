    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Thousands of New Jerseyans have demanded an end to the genocide of the
Palestinian people. Biden is on track to lose the election to Trump unless he
chooses to listen to the working class of this country and change course. Defeat
is certain if he fails to do so. Let Biden know New Jersey uncommits from
genocide and apartheid. This campaign is inspired by the movement <a

This campaign is not an endorsement of any party or candidate, it is a protest
of the current undemocratic political system which has failed to accomodate the

ceasefire in Gaza. We demand the immediate and unrestricted entry of
humanitarian aid into Gaza. We stand for the liberation of Palestine"/>
