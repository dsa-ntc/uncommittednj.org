* This campaign is not an endorsement of any party or candidate, it is a strategic
campaign targeting a political system which has failed to accomodate the
popular demand for justice in Palestine. 

* We demand the immediate cessation of all arms shipments, military, and economic
aid to Israel by the United States.

* We pledge to withhold our votes from Democratic Party candidates in our upcoming
general election unless an arms embargo is delivered prior to the election.

* We stand for the liberation of Palestine.
