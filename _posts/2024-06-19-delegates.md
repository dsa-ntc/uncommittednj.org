**Trenton, NJ** — On June 4, almost 50,000 voters across the Garden State sent a
clear and resounding message to Genocide Joe and his administration: Cease
funding to the Israeli death machine and stop sponsoring the genocide of the
Palestinian people, or prepare to lose the upcoming presidential election.

Despite having only a few months to prepare and relying exclusively on volunteer
labor, the Uncommitted campaign has managed to elect at least three delegates to
represent NJ in the upcoming Democratic National Convention in August 2024.
Together with other delegations from across the country, we are working to form
a coalition that champions ceasefire, Palestinian liberation, and the true will
of democratic voters on the DNC party platform.

As much as we’ve accomplished with this campaign, against the din of pro-war
media coverage and the shameful complicity of our  elected officials in shocking
war crimes, our work doesn’t stop here.

The freedom and liberation of the Palestinian people remain our top priority.
Gaza is still under attack by an apartheid government  hellbent on erasing
Palestinian people from the map demographically, historically, and politically.

Gaza is still under attack because the US  government provides the money,
weapons, and political support that make the continuation of unthinkable war
crimes possible.

But as our campaign has proven, our government does not represent the American
people. The Democratic Party has long claimed the votes of Muslim and Arab
Americans, communities of color, and human rights activists against the
discriminatory, racist policies of the GOP. Yet the Biden administration and the
DNC have revealed themselves to differ from the GOP only in rhetoric. Their
disconnect from reality and brazen inability to represent their voters is truly
shocking.

NJ Democratic voters do not stand with genocide, and consider Joe Biden unfit
for office and criminally complicit. It is abundantly clear that a second Biden
presidency is not only undesirable but also, at this point, truly unattainable.

Hence, we intend to continue our efforts to save the Democratic Party from
itself by creating a broader progressive constituency on issues of labor, the
economy, U.S. foreign policy, equity, justice, as well as by addressing the
basic needs of ordinary Americans.

If you are against our government’s spending of  trillions of our tax dollars to
incinerate whole families—mostly women, children, and babies— in allegedly safe
zones in Gaza, we ask you to join us.

If you feel morally obligated to oppose our government’s complicity in
unthinkable crimes against humanity, then join us.

If you believe that a different, more humane and efficient immigration policy is
both possible and preferable, then join us.

If you want to live in a dignified way as free, working people and you recognize
that the citizens of the wealthiest country in the world have every right to
demand access to free health care and education, then join us.

Our struggle remains a difficult one, but our democracy urgently needs an
alternative to both Trump and Biden. The Democratic Party needs to change
radically in order to stand for something different than just hypocrisy and
empty rhetoric.

Clearly, American voters have had enough!

We all deserve to be free, to be truly represented, and to be truly respected.
We owe it to the martyrs of Palestine and to ourselves not to give up. Their
strength and resilience is powerful and inspiring. Their sacrifice has become
the wake up call the US desperately needed. Let it not be for nothing. 

Defend American democracy. Defend global peace. 

Free, Free Palestine!
