    <p>As political decision-makers gather for the Democratic National Convention this August, join us to send a message to the establishment: the people call for not another bomb! In order to achieve a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, the U.S. must stop arming Israelâ€™s brutal war and occupation on Gaza by enacting an immediate arms embargo.

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Thousands of New Jerseyans have demanded an end to the genocide of the
Palestinian people. Biden is on track to lose the election to Trump unless he
chooses to listen to the working class of this country and change course. Defeat
is certain if he fails to do so. Let Biden know New Jersey uncommits from
genocide and apartheid. This campaign is inspired by the movement <a

    <p>Thank you to all of our <a href="/endorsements">endorsements</a> for helping
    us keep the movement going in New Jersey!</p>
